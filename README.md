# BlocksGL
A Tetris clone using OpenGL'

<hr>
## Notes:
- There is no text in this game yet, so the score is displayed at the top of the screen where the title bar should be. I will wait until I make my OpenGL text renderer library before adding text such as score and a proper game over instead of the program shutting down when you lose.

## Controls:
- W: Rotate
- S: Increase downwards velocity on the shape
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
- M: Quad mode (purely aesthetic, see the demoIimg.PNG)
